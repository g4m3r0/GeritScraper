Your specific task is to identify names of professors in the text and output these details in the specified JSON format. Make sure that the output strictly adheres to the given JSON schema, as it will be used directly as input for another function.

Please provide your response in the following JSON format and do not include any additional text:

      ]
    }
]
}
</SampleOutput>

Note: In the 'Urls' section, please provide any useful (full website) links where more information about the respective professor can be found. If multiple professors are present in the text, include them all in your output.
